# JS-Arkanoid


Code all finished but could stand to be cleaned up a bit(files put in proper folders).
Otherwise I'm pretty happy with this project as it's my 1st real build through javascript.
Breakout/Arkanoid also holds a special place in my heart since I'd dump countless quarters into the old machine at Crystal Dome diner in my
hometown after long nights of drinking at the bar or at a house party. 
Also added my own favicon.svg in place of the tennis ball. 6/29/19
